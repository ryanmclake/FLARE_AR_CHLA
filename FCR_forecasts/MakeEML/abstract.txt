Forecasts of bulk chlorophyll-a (ug/L) were produced for Falling Creek Reservoir, a small drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Forecasts were made within a Bayesian framework using an autoregressive linear model. Forecasts were produced on a daily basis with a forecast horizon of 14 days, meaning forecasts were produced 14 days into the future from the day they were produced. We produced forecasts using three different models with different timesteps: a daily model, a weekly model, and a fortnightly model. Model drivers included shortwave radiation and discharge into the reservoir. All code to import data, calibrate models, and generate and analyze hindcasts are available on Github at https://github.com/wwoelmer/FLARE_AR_CHLA.

Forecasts of bulk chlorophyll-a (ug/L) were produced for Falling Creek Reservoir, a small drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Forecasts were made within a Bayesian framework using an autoregressive linear model. Forecasts were produced on a daily basis with a forecast horizon of 14 days, meaning forecasts were produced up to 14 days into the future from the day they were initiated. We produced forecasts using three different models with different timesteps: a daily model, a weekly model, and a fortnightly model. Model drivers included shortwave radiation and discharge into the reservoir. All code to import data, calibrate models, and generate and analyze forecasts are available on Github at https://github.com/wwoelmer/FLARE_AR_CHLA, EcoAppsReleaseApr2021 branch. This data package is made in association with a manuscript submitted as an Article to Ecological Applications, Woelmer et al. 202X.
